**"Superman is a slacker."**

slacker is a simple RPC framework designed for Clojure and created by Clojure.

## Features

* Fast network infrastucture
* Fast serialization based on Kryo (Text based serialization is also supported)
* Security without additional policies
* Transparent and non-invasive API
* Extensible server with interceptor framework
* Cluster with Zookeeper (moved to [slacker-cluster](https://github.com/sunng87/slacker-cluster))
* Clean code

## Examples

A pair of example server/client can be found under "examples", you
can run the examples by `lein2 run-example-server` and
`lein2 run-example-client`. The example client will print out various 
outputs from the server as well as a RuntimeException: "Excepted exception."
This exception is part of the example - not a genuine error in the slacker 
source code.

## Usage

### Leiningen

    :dependencies [[slacker "0.8.5"]]

### Getting Started

Slacker will expose all your public functions under a given
namespace. 

``` clojure
(ns slapi)
(defn timestamp 
  "return server time in milliseconds"
  []
  (System/currentTimeMillis))

;; ...more functions
```             

To expose `slapi`, use:

``` clojure
(use 'slacker.server)
(start-slacker-server (the-ns 'slapi) 2104)
```

On the client side, define facades for the remote functions.
The `use-remote` function is convenience for importing all functions
under a remote namespace. 

``` clojure
(use 'slacker.client)
(def sc (slackerc "localhost:2104"))
(use-remote 'sc 'slapi)
(timestamp)
```

You can also use `defn-remote` to create facade one by one. Remember
to add remote namespace here as facade name, `slapi/timestamp`,
eg. Otherwise, the name of current namespace will be treated as remote
namespace. 

``` clojure
(defn-remote sc slapi/timestamp)
(timestamp)
```

By checking the metadata of `timestamp`, you can get some useful
information:

``` clojure
(meta timestamp)
=> {:slacker-remote-name "timestamp", :slacker-remote-fn true,
:slacker-client #<SlackerClient
slacker.client.common.SlackerClient@575752>, :slacker-remote-ns
"slapi" :arglists ([]), :name timestamp 
:doc "return server time in milliseconds"}
```

#### Closing the client

``` clojure
(close-slackerc sc)
```

### Options in defn-remote

You can specify the remote function name when there are conflicts in
current namespace.

``` clojure
(defn-remote sc remote-time
  :remote-ns "slapi"
  :remote-name "timestamp")
```

If you add an `:async` flag to `defn-remote`, then the facade will be
asynchronous which returns a *promise* when you call it. You should
deref it by yourself to get the return value.

``` clojure
(defn-remote sc slapi/timestamp :async true)
@(timestamp)
```

You can also assign a callback for an async facade.

``` clojure
(defn-remote sc slapi/timestamp :callback #(println %))
(timestamp)
```

### Serializing custom types

By default, most clojure data types are registered in carbonite. (As
kryo requires you to **register** a class before you can serialize
its instances.) However, you may have additional types to
transport between client and server. To add your own types, you should
register custom serializers on *both server side and client side*. Run
this before you start server or client:

``` clojure
(use '[slacker.serialization])
(register-serializers {Class Serializer)
```
[Carbonite](https://github.com/revelytix/carbonite "carbonite") has
some detailed docs on how to create your own serializers.

### JSON Serialization

Other than binary format, you can also use JSON for
serialization. JSON is a text based format which is more friendly to
human beings. It may be useful for debugging, or communicating with
external applications.

Configure slacker client to use JSON:

``` clojure
(def sc (slackerc "localhost:2104" :content-type :json))
```

One thing you should note is the representation of keyword in
JSON. Keywords and strings are both encoded as JSON string in
transport. But while decoding, all map keys will be decoded to
keyword, and all other strings will be decoded to clojure string. This
may lead to inconsistency of your clojure data structure between server and
client. Try to avoid this by carefully design your data structure or
just using carbonite(default and recommended).

From slacker 0.4.0, clojure pr/read is supported. You can just
set content-type as `:clj`. clojure pr/read has full support on
clojure data structures and also easy for debugging. However, it's
much slower that carbonite so you'd better not use it if you have
critical performance requirements.

### Server interceptors

To add custom functions on server, you can define custom
interceptors before or after function called.

``` clojure
(definterceptor logging-interceptor 
   :before (fn [req] (println (str "calling: " (:fname req))) req))

(start-slacker-server (the-ns 'slapi) 2104
                      :interceptors (interceptors logging-interceptor))
```

For more information about using interceptors and creating your own
interceptors, query the [wiki
page](https://github.com/sunng87/slacker/wiki/Interceptors).

### Slacker on HTTP

From 0.4.0, slacker can be configured to run on HTTP protocol. To
enable HTTP transport, just add a `:http` option to your slacker
server:

``` clojure
(start-slacker-server ...
                      :http 4104)
```

The HTTP url pattern is
http://localhost:4104/*namespace*/*function-name*.*format*.  Arguments
are encoded in *format*, and posted to server via HTTP body. If you
have multiple arguments, you should put them into a clojure vector
(for clj format) or javascript array (for json format).

See a curl example:

``` bash
$ curl -d "[5]" http://localhost:4104/slapi/rand-ints.clj
(38945142 1413770549 1361247669 1899499977 1281637740)
```

Note that you can only use `json` or `clj` as format. Because HTTP is
a test based protocol, so `carb` won't be supported.

### Slacker as a Ring App

You can also use slacker as a ring app with
`slacker.server/slacker-ring-app`. The ring app is fully compatible
with ring spec. So it could be deployed on any ring adapter.

``` clojure
(use 'slacker.server)
(use 'ring.adapter.jetty)

(run-jetty (slacker-ring-app (the-ns 'slapi))  {:port 8080})
```

The url pattern of this ring app is same as slacker's built-in http
module. 

### Access Control List

Slacker 0.7 supports IP based access control list (ACL). Consult [wiki
page](https://github.com/sunng87/slacker/wiki/AccessControlList) for the ACL rule DSL.

## Performance

To test performance, just start an example server with `lein2 run -m
slacker.example.server`. 

Then run the performance test script: 
`lein2 exec -p scripts/performance-test.clj 200000 50`. This will run
200,000 calls with 50 threads.

Tested on my working desktop (DELL optiplex 760, Intel(R) Core(TM)2
Duo CPU E7400 @ 2.80GHz, 8G memory), without any special JVM optimization.
**200,000** calls with **50** threads is completed in **21923.806054
msecs**, which means slacker could handle more than **9000** calls per
second on this machine.
